XConf Open Source Software

***Important Note about Licensing:
The XConf Server uses the Bootstrap framework.  When building XConf Server, Bootstrap and other modules are pulled in by NPM.  Bootstrap contains a small set of Glyphicons.  According to the Bootstrap license, Bootstrap and the included Glyphicons are available to use commercially for free.  However, any party building and using XConf Server should review the licenses and make their own determination.
